# PPL-SI: Post-Pretrained Lasso Statistical Inference

**PPL-SI** is a Python package designed to provide statistically valid inference for high-dimensional regression in transfer and distributed learning settings. It specifically targets the **Pretrained Lasso** and **D-TransFusion** algorithms, ensuring rigorous control of the False Positive Rate (FPR) while maintaining high statistical power (TPR).

The framework addresses the selection bias inherent in multi-stage training pipelines by explicitly characterizing the selection events and computing valid p-values conditioned on the model selection.

## 🖼️ Method Overview

### 1. The PPL-SI Framework
PPL-SI corrects the selection bias in the Pretrained Lasso pipeline (and its parameter-only/distributed variants). As shown below, naive p-values are often invalid (inflated Type I error), whereas PPL-SI successfully distinguishes between true signals and false positives.

### 2. Divide-and-Conquer Strategy
To compute valid p-values, we identify the truncation region $\mathcal{Z}$ where the feature selection event remains invariant. PPL-SI employs an efficient **divide-and-conquer algorithm** to decompose the problem into sub-intervals, solving for linear inequalities in parallel.

## 🚀 Features

- **Valid Inference for Transfer Learning**: Supports both **Pretrained Lasso** (data sharing) and **Parameter-Only Pretrained Lasso** (privacy-preserving).
- **Distributed Learning Support**: Extends selective inference to **D-TransFusion** (distributed one-shot transfer learning).
- **Exact FPR Control**: Theoretically guarantees control of the False Positive Rate at any significance level $\alpha$.
- **High-Performance Computing**: Implements a parallelized algorithm using `joblib` to handle high-dimensional data efficiently.
